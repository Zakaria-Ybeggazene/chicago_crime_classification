# chicago_crime_classification
This repository contains a python notebook in which I developped a Machine Learning model,
by going through the different steps of a Data project, for classifying crimes occuring in Chicago
(based on the dataset in the following link : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2)
as part of the **"Projet Analyse de Donn√©es"** course taught at Paris Dauphine University to last year of the IM2D bachelor's degree students.
